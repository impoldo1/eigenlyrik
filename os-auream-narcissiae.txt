Aureum os narcissi

In times when real estate tries clumsy stately craft.
A screeching eagle-tweagle, leaves golden nest, how daft.

By tweets, by-passing media, the brute cuts to critique.
Excoriated pulsing chest, of 'corpus politique'.

Will pass at octoginta age, and still-in-power be.
Maximo Lead, American.
Del Norte. Boss for thee.

In history books, a by-line reads: 
"The tweagle ate their heart. Resuscitation was too late, the country fell apart."

My fingers crossed and pointed: 
"Behold real eagles in the sky. Like PhoenÄ«x from the stars."
