"Os auream Narcissiae"

We live in times of real estate, turned awful stage fright craft.
When tweeting eagle-tweagle, left golden cage, how daft.

By tweets, by-passed el media, and cut right to critique.
Excoriated pulsing chest, of 'corpus politique'.

Will pass the age of octogen, and still-in-power be.
Maximo Lead, American.
Del Norte. Boss for thee.

In history books, a by-line: 
"The tweagle ate their heart. Resucitation failed, the country fell apart."

My fingers crossed and pointed: 
"Behold! Real eagles come. Phonixiae, from ashes of the stars ..."
